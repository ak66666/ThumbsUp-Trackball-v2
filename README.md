# ThumbsUp! Trackball

A PCB-based thumb-operated trackball, inspired by Elecom EX-G left hand trackball, Ploopy Nano trackball, and my own ThumbsUp! keyboards.

To be suitable for both left- and right-hand usage.
The top two the plates can be re-attached at 180 degree and the cross-board connectors will swap left and right buttons, and the firmware will change the trackball movement direction.
 
Off-the-shelf ProMicro-style MCUs are considered: 
- Atmega- or RP2040-driven with QMK-based firmware - wired.
- nice!nano v2 (and clones) with ZMK-based firmware - wireless.

34 mm ball, same as in Elecom EX-G.
For bearings - uxcell 2.5mm Ceramic Bearing Balls, ZrO2 Zirconium Oxide Ball, again, the same as used to improve my Elecom trackballs.
Bearings to be implanted into PCBs, no 3D-printed ball shroud/holder.
